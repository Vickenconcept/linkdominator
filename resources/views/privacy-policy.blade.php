        <h4><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. 
            The cookie will help our Site, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit. 
            For example, cookies can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyse how well our website is performing, 
            or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5><strong><em>We may use cookies for the following reasons and purposes:</em></strong></h5>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To provide the service you have asked for. Some cookies are essential so you can navigate through the website and use its 
                    features. Without these cookies, we would not be able to provide the services you've requested. For example, some cookies 
                    allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription only pages. If a subscriber opts to disable 
                    these cookies, the user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles them to. These cookies 
                    don't gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet. 
                    Essential cookies keep you logged in during your visit, ensure that when you add something to the online shopping basket, 
                    it's still there when you get to the checkout and make it possible to navigate through the website smoothly (session cookies).

                    To improve your browsing experience. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as your language or 
                    region and they provide improved features. These cookies will help remembering your preferences and settings, including 
                    marketing preferences, remembering if you've filled in certain forms, so you're not asked to do it again, remembering if 
                    you've been to the site before and restricting the number of times you're shown a particular advertisement. We might also 
                    use these cookies to highlight site services that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the website.

                    Analytics. To improve your experience on our Site, we like to keep track of what pages and links are popular and which ones 
                    don't get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. It's also very useful to be able to identify trends 
                    of how people navigate (find their way through) our sites and if they get error messages from web pages. This group of cookies, 
                    often called “analytics cookies” are used to gather this information. These cookies don't collect information that identifies 
                    you. The information collected is anonymous and is grouped with the information from everyone else's cookies. We can then see 
                    the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person's activity. Analytics cookies only record activity on the site you are 
                    on and they are only used to improve how a website works.

                    To show advertising that is relevant to your interests. We sell space on our Site to advertisers. The resulting adverts often 
                    contain cookies. These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit 
                    the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are 
                    usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information 
                    is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site 
                    functionality provided by the other organisation. Our emails may contain a single, campaign-unique “web beacon pixel” to tell 
                    us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links or advertisements within the email. We may use this 
                    information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to users, to query whether users who do 
                    not open our emails wish to continue receiving them and to inform our advertisers in aggregate how many users have clicked on 
                    their advertisements. The pixel will be deleted when you delete the email. If you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to 
                    your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.
